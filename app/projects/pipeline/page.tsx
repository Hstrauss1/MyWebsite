            This 5-stage pipelined CPU was implemented in Verilog HDL based on
            the SCU ISA, with support for 12 instructions including arithmetic,
            memory, and control flow operations. Instructions follow a fixed
            32-bit format, and the pipeline includes IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB
            stages with hazard-handling logic.
            <br />
            <br />
            The CPU was tested with assembly programs like a MIN function and
            vector addition. Control signals are managed via a centralized unit
            with a truth table, and data/control flow is verified through
            waveform simulation. The pipeline achieves one-instruction-per-cycle
            throughput in ideal cases, with performance analysis estimating a
            base CPI of ~1.5 and max clock frequency of 250 MHz.
